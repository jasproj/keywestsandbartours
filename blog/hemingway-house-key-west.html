        <h1>Hemingway House Key West: The Famous Cats, History & Visiting Guide</h1>
        <p class="blog-meta">Updated January 2025 • 8 min read</p>
        
        <p>The Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum is one of Key West's most beloved attractions, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. But while the Nobel Prize-winning author's legacy is impressive, many visitors come for an entirely different reason: the <strong>famous six-toed cats</strong> that roam the property.</p>
        
        <p>Here's everything you need to know about visiting the Hemingway House, meeting the polydactyl cats, and exploring this piece of American literary history.</p>

        <h2>The History of Hemingway in Key West</h2>
        
        <p>Ernest Hemingway first arrived in Key West in 1928 with his second wife, Pauline Pfeiffer. They were originally just passing through on their way to Paris, but car trouble stranded them on the island. Hemingway fell in love with Key West's laid-back lifestyle, excellent fishing, and tropical beauty.</p>
        
        <p>In 1931, Pauline's uncle purchased the house at 907 Whitehead Street as a wedding gift for the couple. The Spanish Colonial-style home, built in 1851, became Hemingway's primary residence for nearly a decade.</p>
        
        <p>During his Key West years (1931-1939), Hemingway wrote some of his most acclaimed works, including:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"A Farewell to Arms"</strong> (finished here)</li>
            <li><strong>"To Have and Have Not"</strong> (set in Key West)</li>
            <li><strong>"The Snows of Kilimanjaro"</strong></li>
            <li><strong>"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber"</strong></li>
            <li><strong>"Death in the Afternoon"</strong></li>
            <li><strong>"Green Hills of Africa"</strong></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Hemingway wrote in a studio above the carriage house, accessible by a catwalk from the main house's second floor. The studio remains preserved much as it was during his writing years.</p>

        <h2>The Famous Six-Toed Cats</h2>
        
        <p>The Hemingway Home is now home to approximately <strong>60 polydactyl cats</strong> — cats born with extra toes. Normal cats have 18 toes (5 on each front paw, 4 on each back paw), but polydactyl cats can have as many as 28.</p>
        
        <h3>How Did the Cats Get There?</h3>
        
        <p>Legend has it that a ship captain named Stanley Dexter gave Hemingway a white six-toed cat named Snow White (or "Snowball" in some accounts). The polydactyl gene is dominant, meaning about half of Snow White's offspring inherited the trait.</p>
        
        <p>Today's cats are descendants of that original cat. They've been living on the property for over 80 years, and the Hemingway Home has a special license to maintain the colony.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>🐱 Cat Facts</h4>
            <p>All the cats at the Hemingway Home are named after famous people — authors, actors, and historical figures. You might meet cats named Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, Charlie Chaplin, or Archibald MacLeish. About half have the distinctive six-toed paws.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Can You Pet the Cats?</h3>
        
        <p>Yes! The cats roam freely throughout the property and are generally friendly toward visitors. You'll find them lounging on furniture, napping in gardens, and occasionally photobombing your pictures. They're well-fed and well-cared-for, with their own veterinarian, a dedicated caretaker, and even a cat cemetery on the grounds.</p>
        
        <p>The cats have free reign of the house and grounds, including Hemingway's writing studio. Don't be surprised if one decides to join you during your tour.</p>

        <h2>Visiting the Hemingway House</h2>
        
        <h3>Location</h3>

        <h3>Hours</h3>

            <li><strong>Key West residents:</strong> Free (with valid ID)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>What's Included</h3>
        <p>Your admission includes a guided tour led by knowledgeable staff who share stories about Hemingway's life, his writing process, and the history of the house. Tours run continuously throughout the day, lasting about 30 minutes. You're welcome to stay and explore the grounds at your own pace afterward.</p>

        <h2>What to See at the Hemingway House</h2>
        
        <h3>The Main House</h3>
        <p>The house is preserved with period furnishings, many of which are original pieces owned by Hemingway and Pauline. You'll see European antiques, Spanish furniture, and artwork collected during the couple's travels.</p>
        
        <h3>The Writing Studio</h3>
        <p>Hemingway's second-floor writing studio sits above the carriage house. His typewriter remains on the desk where he wrote thousands of words each morning. He famously wrote standing up at a small table.</p>
        
        <h3>The Pool</h3>
        <p>Key West's first in-ground swimming pool, installed in 1937 at a cost of $20,000 (equivalent to about $400,000 today). Legend says Pauline had it built while Hemingway was covering the Spanish Civil War. When he returned and learned the cost, he threw a penny at her feet saying, "You might as well have my last cent." That penny is now embedded in the concrete next to the pool.</p>
        
        <h3>The Gardens</h3>
        <p>Lush tropical gardens surround the property, featuring native plants, towering palms, and plenty of shady spots where cats like to nap.</p>
        
        <h3>The Cat Cemetery</h3>
        <p>A small cemetery behind the house honors deceased feline residents with engraved headstones.</p>

        <h2>Tips for Your Visit</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Go early or late:</strong> The house gets crowded midday, especially when cruise ships are in port. Morning or late afternoon visits are more peaceful.</li>
            <li><strong>Wear comfortable shoes:</strong> You'll be walking and standing on uneven surfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Bring a camera:</strong> The cats, house, and gardens are incredibly photogenic.</li>
            <li><strong>Allow 1-2 hours:</strong> The tour is 30 minutes, but you'll want time to explore and photograph the cats.</li>
            <li><strong>Check for events:</strong> The house occasionally hosts special events and readings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hemingway's Key West Legacy</h2>
        
        <p>Beyond the house, Hemingway's presence is felt throughout Key West. <strong>Sloppy Joe's Bar</strong> on Duval Street was his favorite watering hole (though the original location was on Greene Street). Every July, the <strong>Hemingway Days Festival</strong> celebrates his legacy with a famous look-alike contest, fishing tournaments, and literary events.</p>
        
        <p>The character of Key West that attracted Hemingway — its independent spirit, tropical beauty, and slightly rebellious nature — remains today. Walking the same streets he walked, you can understand why this island captivated one of America's greatest writers.</p>
