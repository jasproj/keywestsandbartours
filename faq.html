                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Browse tours, filter by area or activity, and click "Book Now." You'll be connected directly with the tour operator's booking system. Most offer free cancellation 24-48 hours before your activity. We feature over 476 tours from verified local operators.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>During peak season (December-April), book 1-2 weeks ahead for popular tours. Sunset cruises and private charters fill fastest. Off-season, a few days notice is usually fine. Last-minute availability exists, but you'll have fewer choices. Sign up for our deals to catch cancellations!</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Sandbar tours take you to shallow sandbars in the backcountry where you can wade in crystal-clear, waist-deep water, relax, swim, and enjoy the stunning Keys scenery. Popular spots include Snipes Point, Woman Key, and Boca Grande. Many tours include snorkeling stops, drinks, and snacks. It's one of the most popular Key West experiences!</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The most popular sandbars include Snipes Point (great for beginners), Woman Key (beautiful and secluded), Boca Grande (crystal-clear water), Jewfish Basin (calm and shallow), and the Mud Keys area. Each has its own character, and most sandbar tours visit multiple spots.</p>

                    <p>The backcountry refers to the shallow flats, mangrove islands, and sandbars on the Gulf side of Key West (north/northwest). It's calmer than the Atlantic side, with crystal-clear water perfect for sandbar trips, kayaking, paddleboarding, and wildlife watching.</p>

                <summary>What should I bring on a boat tour?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Essentials include: reef-safe sunscreen, sunglasses, hat, swimsuit, towel, and water. Most boats provide snorkel gear. Consider bringing a waterproof phone case and motion sickness prevention if you're prone to seasickness. Some tours allow you to bring your own food and drinks (BYOB).</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Tour lengths vary: quick trips like parasailing are about 1 hour. Snorkeling and sandbar tours typically run 3-4 hours. Half-day fishing charters are 4-5 hours. Full-day adventures can be 6-8 hours. Sunset cruises are usually 2 hours. Private charters let you customize duration.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Many tours are BYOB (bring your own beverages), while others include drinks or offer a cash bar. Check individual tour descriptions. Some sunset cruises and party boats feature open bars with beer, wine, and cocktails included in the price.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The backcountry (where sandbar tours go) has calmer water than the open ocean. If prone to seasickness, take preventative medication before boarding, stay on deck with fresh air, watch the horizon, and avoid heavy meals. Ginger and acupressure bands can help too.</p>

                    <p>Safety comes first! If weather conditions are unsafe, operators will reschedule or offer a full refund. Most cancellation policies allow free rebooking 24-48 hours in advance. Check individual tour policies, and consider booking early in your trip so you have backup days.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes! Private charters give you exclusive use of a boat with your own captain. Perfect for families, groups, special occasions, or anyone wanting a personalized experience. You can customize the itinerary—combine snorkeling, sandbar time, sunset viewing, or fishing in one trip.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Absolutely! Bottlenose dolphins are commonly spotted in the backcountry waters. Dedicated dolphin tours take you to their favorite spots, but you might also see them on sandbar trips, sunset cruises, or even kayak tours. Morning trips often have the best dolphin sightings.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Top snorkel spots include Sand Key (shallow reef, great for beginners), Eastern Dry Rocks (diverse coral and fish), Western Dry Rocks (larger marine life), and the Vandenberg wreck (advanced). The reef is about 5 miles offshore—you'll need a boat tour to reach it.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Not necessarily! Many tours offer flotation devices and you can enjoy sandbars while wading in shallow water. However, snorkeling and diving activities do require basic swimming ability. Always let your captain know about your comfort level in the water.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The sanctuary protects 2,900 square nautical miles of waters surrounding the Keys, including the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States. All tours operate within these protected waters. Responsible operators help preserve this unique ecosystem for future generations.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Reef-safe sunscreen is free from oxybenzone and octinoxate—chemicals that damage coral reefs. These ingredients are banned in the Florida Keys. Look for mineral-based sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. Protecting the reef helps preserve Key West's incredible snorkeling.</p>

                <summary>What's the difference between Key West and Stock Island tours?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Key West tours typically depart from marinas near downtown and Old Town. Stock Island (just north of Key West) offers a more local, less touristy experience with excellent fishing and diving operations. Both areas access the same beautiful waters—it's mainly about departure location.</p>

                <summary>Do I need to tip boat captains and crew?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Tipping is customary and appreciated. Standard gratuity is 15-20% of the tour cost, similar to restaurant service. For exceptional service or private charters, 20%+ is common. Tips are often the primary income for crew members. Cash is preferred but some operators accept card tips.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Most tours welcome children! Sandbar trips are perfect for families—kids love playing in the shallow, calm water. Many operators offer life jackets for little ones. Check individual tour descriptions for age recommendations. Some fishing and diving tours may have minimum age requirements.</p>
