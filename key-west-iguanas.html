        <h1>Invasive Iguanas in Key West: Where to See Them & Florida Hunting Rules</h1>
        
        <p class="blog-meta">Updated January 2025 • 8 min read</p>
        
        <p>If you've spent any time in Key West, you've probably noticed the large green lizards sunbathing on seawalls, scurrying across sidewalks, and lounging in palm trees. These are <strong>green iguanas</strong> — and while they might look like exotic tropical wildlife, they're actually an invasive species causing significant problems throughout the Florida Keys.</p>
        
        <p>Whether you're fascinated by these prehistoric-looking reptiles or curious about Florida's iguana hunting regulations, here's everything you need to know about Key West's iguana population.</p>

        <h2>Why Are There So Many Iguanas in Key West?</h2>
        
        <p>Green iguanas (Iguana iguana) are not native to Florida. They originated in Central and South America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. So how did they end up taking over the Florida Keys?</p>
        
        <p>The invasion began in the 1960s when pet iguanas were released or escaped into the wild. Florida's warm, humid climate proved perfect for these cold-blooded reptiles, and without natural predators, their population exploded. Today, there are estimated to be <strong>hundreds of thousands of iguanas</strong> in South Florida, with Key West being a major hotspot.</p>
        
        <p>Female iguanas can lay 20-70 eggs per year, and they can live 15-20 years in the wild. Do the math, and you'll understand why they've become such a problem.</p>

        <h2>Where to See Iguanas in Key West</h2>
        
        <p>Honestly? You don't have to look hard. Iguanas are everywhere in Key West. But if you want the best iguana-spotting locations, try these spots:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fort Zachary Taylor State Park</strong> — Iguanas love the rocky shoreline and vegetation here. You'll see them sunning on rocks and climbing trees.</li>
            <li><strong>Higgs Beach</strong> — The seawalls and nearby vegetation are prime iguana territory.</li>
            <li><strong>West Martello Tower</strong> — The historic fort's gardens attract dozens of iguanas daily.</li>
            <li><strong>Key West Cemetery</strong> — The old trees and quiet grounds make this an iguana paradise.</li>
            <li><strong>Smathers Beach</strong> — Check the vegetation along the beach for basking iguanas.</li>
            <li><strong>Any seawall or dock</strong> — Iguanas love to sun themselves on concrete and rocks near water.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The best time to spot iguanas is mid-morning to early afternoon when they're most active and basking in the sun. On cooler days (below 50°F), iguanas become immobilized and may fall from trees — a phenomenon Floridians call "frozen iguanas."</p>

        <h2>The Problem with Invasive Iguanas</h2>
        
        <p>While iguanas might seem harmless, they cause serious damage throughout the Florida Keys:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure damage</strong> — Iguanas dig burrows that undermine seawalls, foundations, sidewalks, and canal banks. This erosion costs millions in repairs.</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetation destruction</strong> — They devour native plants, landscaping, and gardens. A single iguana can strip a hibiscus bush overnight.</li>
            <li><strong>Threat to native wildlife</strong> — Iguanas compete with native species for food and habitat, and they eat the eggs of endangered species like the Miami blue butterfly.</li>
            <li><strong>Health concerns</strong> — Iguanas can carry salmonella and their droppings contaminate pools, docks, and outdoor areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Airport hazards</strong> — Key West International Airport has had to deal with iguanas on runways.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>🦎 Iguana Fast Facts</h4>
            <p>Adult green iguanas can grow up to 5 feet long and weigh over 15 pounds. They're excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for up to 30 minutes underwater. Despite their intimidating appearance, they're herbivores — but they will bite and whip their tails if threatened.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Florida Iguana Hunting Laws & Regulations</h2>
        
        <p>Here's where it gets interesting. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) actually <strong>encourages</strong> the removal of green iguanas from the wild. They are not protected in Florida except by anti-cruelty laws.</p>
        
        <h3>What's Legal:</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Iguanas can be humanely killed on private property <strong>with landowner permission</strong></li>
            <li>No hunting license is required to kill iguanas on private property</li>
            <li>You can capture and remove iguanas from your own property at any time</li>
            <li>There are no bag limits or size restrictions</li>
            <li>Professional iguana removal services are legal and widely available</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>What's NOT Legal:</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Hunting iguanas on public property without specific authorization</li>
            <li>Using firearms in areas where discharge is prohibited (most of Key West)</li>
            <li>Relocating and releasing captured iguanas — this is illegal in Florida</li>
            <li>Cruel or inhumane killing methods</li>
            <li>Hunting on private property without explicit permission from the owner</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>⚠️ Important Legal Note</h4>
            <p>While iguana removal is encouraged, you cannot simply walk around Key West hunting iguanas. Firearm discharge is prohibited in most areas, and you need landowner permission for private property. Always check local ordinances before attempting any iguana removal.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Can You Eat Iguanas?</h2>
        
        <p>Yes! Iguana meat is consumed throughout Central and South America, where it's sometimes called <strong>"gallina de palo"</strong> (chicken of the tree). The meat is high in protein, low in fat, and reportedly tastes like chicken with a slightly gamey flavor.</p>
        
        <p>Some Key West restaurants have experimented with iguana dishes, and there's a small but dedicated community of iguana hunters who harvest them for food. If you're adventurous, iguana tacos are apparently quite good.</p>
        
        <p>However, proper preparation is essential — iguanas can carry salmonella, so thorough cooking is mandatory.</p>

        <h2>Professional Iguana Removal Services</h2>
        
        <p>If you're a property owner dealing with iguana damage, professional removal services are available throughout the Keys. These services typically offer:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Humane trapping and removal</li>
            <li>Population assessment</li>
            <li>Burrow destruction to prevent return</li>
            <li>Deterrent installation</li>
            <li>Ongoing maintenance programs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Costs vary, but expect to pay $50-150 per iguana removed, or monthly service contracts for ongoing control.</p>

        <h2>Iguana-Watching Etiquette</h2>
        
        <p>If you're just visiting Key West and want to observe these fascinating (if problematic) reptiles, here are some tips:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep your distance</strong> — Iguanas can bite and their tails pack a wallop</li>
            <li><strong>Don't feed them</strong> — This encourages population growth and habituation to humans</li>
            <li><strong>Watch for droppings</strong> — Iguana feces can carry salmonella</li>
            <li><strong>Supervise pets</strong> — Dogs may chase iguanas, which can lead to bites</li>
            <li><strong>Great for photos</strong> — They often sit still for long periods while basking</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Future of Key West's Iguanas</h2>
        
        <p>Despite removal efforts, iguana populations continue to grow throughout the Florida Keys. Climate change may actually help — warmer winters mean fewer "cold stun" events that naturally control populations.</p>
        
        <p>For now, iguanas are simply part of life in Key West. Love them or hate them, these green giants have become as iconic to the island as chickens, cats, and sunset celebrations.</p>
        
        <p>Next time you're in Key West, keep your eyes peeled — you're guaranteed to spot at least a few of these prehistoric-looking invaders soaking up the Florida sun.</p>
